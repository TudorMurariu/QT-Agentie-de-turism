# QT-Agentie-de-turism

&nbsp; Tourism Agency App in C++ for semester project for OOP course. My main purpose at the time was practicing the OOP concepts. I have acquired strong knowledge about memory management:Rule of three(C++),Rule of five(C++),RAII,memory leaks,dangling pointers,smart pointers.I implement a small part from class ‘vector’ from STL C++ using concepts like iterators,template etc.Beside of OOP concepts and design patterns(Observer,Model-ViewController) , I have learned about signals,slots for graphical user interface using QT.

In the app we manage diffrent offers offers.

Take a look at the UI :

We can filter or sort our offers by different properties:

The app also contains an wishlist.

In the wishlist we have the option to add a number of random items. 
For this functionality I used the prebuilt shuffle in C++:
