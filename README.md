# QT-Agentie-de-turism

 Tourism Agency App in C++ for semester project for OOP course. My main purpose at the time was practicing the OOP concepts. I have acquired strong knowledge about memory management:Rule of three(C++),Rule of five(C++),RAII,memory leaks,dangling pointers,smart pointers.I implement a small part from class ‘vector’ from STL C++ using concepts like iterators,template etc.Beside of OOP concepts and design patterns(Observer,Model-ViewController) , I have learned about signals,slots for graphical user interface using QT.
